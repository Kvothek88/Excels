# Excels
Some Excel projects with VBA

1st project is a Pathfinder 2nd Edition Alchemist template with automated functionalities.

2nd project is a Monopoly Stock Exchange calculator. The board game has a Calculator on its own but I made this macro excel to replace it. It keeps track of the player's stocks and their value change over time around a fixed value. Additionally the stock values of a company increase or decrease if you buy or sell stocks from it respectively through a logic that I reverse engineered from the game's real calculator. There are some VBA macro buttons to automatically implement some specific Action Cards or transactions(rent, buy stocks, how much you take if you pass the start etc) or reset the game.
