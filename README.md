# Excels
Some Excel projects with VBA

1st project is a Pathfinder 2nd Edition Alchemist template with automated functionalities.

2nd project is a Monopoly Stock Exchange calculator. The board game has a Calculator on its own but I made this macro excel to replace it. It keeps track of the players' stocks and their value change over time around a fixed value. Additionally the stock values of a company increase or decrease if you buy or sell stocks from it respectively through a logic that I reverse engineered from the game's real calculator. It also displays the companies rents. Lastly there are some VBA macro buttons to automatically implement some specific Action Cards or transactions(rent, buy/sell stocks, how much you take if you pass the start etc) or reset the game.
